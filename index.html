As such I consider the westside my home. I am a TCOM major with a VCD and PR emphasis. To the right you can see my appearence just 22 short years ago, if I can go from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosiahBaldwin/JosiahBaldwin.github.io/master/img/10325322_10204154355436175_1628715153887650435_n.jpg">this</a> to <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JosiahBaldwin/JosiahBaldwin.github.io/master/img/12187819_1013131275374034_7874430223503911590_n.jpg">this</a> in just 22 short years, imagine what I can do in the work place in just 5 years! See what I did there? I demonstrated my knowledge of HTML/CSS by embedding links. Basic? Yes. But it gave me a reason to impress you with both my handle on basic HTML and my cutting wit. My weakest area is my professionalism. My strongest area is my obedience.</p>
